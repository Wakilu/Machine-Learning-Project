# Machine-Learning-Project
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

The role of banking in financial industry as well as in economic growth cannot be quantified. However, low product uptake affects the growth of the sector,  hence the need for a model that robustly predicts uptake of products among existing and prospective customers. In this research, we compared the performances of four (4) machine learning models in predicting product uptake. 

The classifiers considered were Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
The data used in the classification was from the 2011 Bank Marketing, which are available at:
